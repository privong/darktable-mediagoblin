# Darktable to Mediagoblin

Generate a csv file to batch upload images to a [Mediagoblin](http://mediagoblin.org) instance based on the tagging information from [Darktable](http;//darktable.org) metadata.
The genesis of this script was that I got tired of entering all the tagging information into Darktable, only to have to do it all over again when uploading the images to mediagoblin.

## Requirements

This script will be tested with python3.

This script uses the `lxml` library.
